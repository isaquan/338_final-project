					<p> It was really hot today. Like unbearably hot. Finaly feels like summer. But it probably won't last that long because the weather tends to do that here. Thanks SLO.

					<p> It was really cold today. SLO also seems to have strange hot/cold weather throughout the week. I thought it was summer?!</p><p>
						EDIT: It was really hot on Friday. I posted this on Monday.

					<h3>April 26, 2017</h3>
					<p> I have been terrible at practicing my hand lettering. Oftentimes I get pretty discouraged about how my lettering looks, and so I stop practicing, which means I stop posting. This is the first thing I've written all month. So I apologize for not keeping this up. But hey, this "S" looks cool.</p>

					<h3>March 31, 2017</h3>
					<p> White noise is such a must. It's literally the only thing I can listen to when I'm studying because listening to music can be so distracting, especially when there's lyrics. White noise sounds like nothing, and it helps me block everything out. So if I'm ever in deep concentration mode with earphones in, you can bet my mind is being flooded with nothing haha.</p>

					<h3>March 30, 2017</h3>
					<p> I'm home for spring break, and this was my way of being quirky and funny. I was thinking of writing a cool "California", but with a funny twist. Because who doesn't love burritos with guac, and french fries?</p>

					<p> It's Spring Break 2k17! I'm just home for the break after a long and exhausting quarter. So happy to have the week off to laze around. And hopefully practice more hand lettering.</p>

					<h3>March 20, 2017</h3>
					<p> I was feeling fancy and I tried to make this look cool. Little backstory: I'm Chinese, and my grandfather was from Hong Kong. I was planning on lettering locations that are part of my life, so this is one of them. My grandfather died when I was in 5th grade, and he was such a huge influence on my family and me. He was the coolest, happiest person I ever knew.</p>

					<h3>March 17, 2017</h3>
					<p> Today is St. Patrick's day. Here, in the lovely college town of SLO, there are lots of people running around, screaming, probably enjoying the celebratory holiday of drinking booze, and all I can think of is how pleasant tomorrow morning will be for everyone. Meanwhile, I'm just at home scribbling this and stuff. Good luck to all of them.</p>
