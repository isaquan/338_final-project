					<p> I was feeling fancy and I tried to make this look cool. Little backstory: I'm Chinese, and my grandfather was from Hong Kong. I was planning on lettering locations that are part of my life, so this is one of them. My grandfather died when I was in 5th grade, and he was such a huge influence on my family and me. He was the coolest, happiest person I ever knew. Miss him.</p>

					<h3>March 17, 2017</h3>
					<p> Today is St. Patrick's day. Here, in the lovely college town of SLO, there are lots of people running around, screaming, probably enjoying the celebratory holiday of drinking booze, and all I can think of is how pleasant tomorrow morning will be for everyone. Meanwhile, I'm just at home scribbling this and stuff. Good luck to all of them.</p>
