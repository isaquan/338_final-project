					<p> Happy mama's day to all the beautiful and strong women out who take care of those wild tiny people. Happy momma's day to those incredible women who raised other incredible people. I am really sad to not be home to celebrate my mom, because she's the reason I am who I am. Thank you for everything mami. Happy mother's day. </p>
