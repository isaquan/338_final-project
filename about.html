		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		
		<p> Welcome to my blog website thingamajig. </p> 
		
		<p> My name is Isabel. I am currently a student living in California. Hand lettering is kind of a hobby I've been pursuing for quite a while now. I'm not very consistant in creating new stuff, so I am hoping that this website will force me to practice and post more regularly. I'm excited to learn a lot more about lettering and typography the more I practice.</p>
		
		<p>This website is a result of a really cool project for my Web Development and Content Management class. I hope you are entertained by this website. I will try my best to be clever, witty, and not boring. Thanks for joining me and please enjoy!</p>
